# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is a Front-end Web Application to visualize various graph path-finding algorithms.

Visit the web app by [clicking here ðŸš€](https://algo-visualizer-vvit.netlify.app/)

## Algorithms 
* BFS
* Bi-directional BFS
* DFS
* Greedy Best first search
* A* search
* Dijkstra's

## DataStructures
* Priority Queue

## Tech Stack
* React JS
* BootStrap

## How it Works
* User can drag around a start and end node and set them in any place.
* User can draw walls by clicking an dragging the mouse pointer.
* User can optionally randomize the walls in the maze and add more walls by dragging the mouse.
* User can add weights to blocks and can randomize the weights.
* Users can then choose a speed of the visualization.
